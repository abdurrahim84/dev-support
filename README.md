W3C Developer Advocates are people who’ve accepted responsibility for doing developer-focused tasks for particular specifications.
If you’ve agreed to be a W3C Developer Advocate, it’s recommended you commit at least 45 to 60 minutes each day (4 to 5 hours each week) on tasks related to the specifications you’ve taken responsibility for.
One of the key areas of responsibilities you’re expected to focus your time on is developer support.

Regardless of which specifications you’ve accepted responsibility for as a W3C Developer Advocate, there are a common set of tasks you're likely to focus your time one; the details of those tasks are summarized in this document.

### Stack Overflow: Monitor and answer questions

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a primary tool that web developers around the world rely on every day in their work. As a W3C Developer Advocate, you can support developers by helping to add good answers to Stack Overflow.

There are two key ways you can find questions at Stack Overflow to answer:

* Use Stack Overflow’s [search page](https://stackoverflow.com/search) to search for feature names from the specifications you’ve taken responsibility for as a W3C Developer Advocate.

* Subscribe to particular Stack Overflow tags.

### MDN documentation: Monitor issues and pull requests, and contribute content

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) is, along with Stack Overflow, a primary tool that web developers around the world rely on every day in their work. As a W3C Developer Advocate, you can support developers by helping to improve MDN content.

[MDN content](https://github.com/mdn/content) is managed in a GitHub repo. So the tasks involved in improving MDN content include:

* Write new MDN documentation for features defined in the specifications you’ve taken responsibility for as a W3C Developer Advocate, and raise pull requests in the [MDN content](https://github.com/mdn/content) repo to get your contributions added to MDN.
  The README file in the MDN content repo [provides detailed guidance](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/README.md#making-contributions) on how to make content contributions to MDN.

* Monitor [the list of open issues](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues) in the MDN content repo, looking for any issues related to features from specifications you’ve taken responsibility for as a W3C Developer Advocate. If you find an issue which you’ve got the ability to resolve, post a comment to the issue asking that it be assigned to you, and then create a pull request with an MDN content change that resolves the issue.

* Monitor [the list of open pull requests](https://github.com/mdn/content/pulls) in the MDN content repo, looking for any pull requests related to features from specifications you’ve taken responsibility for as a W3C Developer Advocate. If you find a pull request which you’ve got the domain knowledge (technical knowledge) to help review, then review the PR changes, and post a comment.

### BCD data: Monitor issues and pull requests, and contribute data

[BCD](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data) is the source of data for all the Browser Compatibility tables that appear in MDN articles. As a W3C Developer Advocate, you can support developers by helping to improve the quality and completeness of the browser-compatibility data in BCD.

* Add new BCD data for features defined in the specifications you’ve taken responsibility for as a W3C Developer Advocate, and raise pull requests in the [BCD](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data) repo to get your contributions added to BCD.
  The contributing.md file in the MDN content repo [provides detailed guidance](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/docs/contributing.md) on how to make content contributions to BCD.

* Monitor [the list of open issues](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues) in the BCD content repo, looking for any issues related to features from specifications you’ve taken responsibility for as a W3C Developer Advocate. If you find an issue which you’ve got the ability to resolve, post a comment to the issue asking that it be assigned to you, and then create a pull request with an BCD content change that resolves the issue.

* Monitor [the list of open pull requests](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pulls) in the BCD repo, looking for any pull requests related to features from specifications you’ve taken responsibility for as a W3C Developer Advocate. If you find a pull request which you’ve got the domain knowledge (technical knowledge) and browser-version knowledge to help review, then review the PR changes, and post a comment.
